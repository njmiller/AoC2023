Advent of Code 2023 in Ocaml. All problems have been solved using utop. I am just slowly migrating the solutions to a dune project.

This was meant to teach me Ocaml so there are probably ways of doing some problems better (i.e. string parsing vs interating over a list of characters)

# Issues

There is some warning about pattern matching not being exhaustive in problem 2, which I don't understand. The code gives the correct answer if run in release mode where warnings are not errors.
